# Bouncing Balls

Bouncing Balls is an interactive web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic simulation of colorful balls bouncing within a confined window.

## Overview

This project showcases the principles of web animation and interactivity, providing users with an engaging visual experience. The balls move dynamically, bouncing off the edges of the window, creating a lively and entertaining display.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons:** Use the "Add Ball" button to introduce more balls into the simulation and the "Remove Ball" button to eliminate them.

- **Dynamic Animation:** The balls move dynamically, changing direction upon collision with window borders, creating a visually appealing bouncing effect.

- **Randomized Properties:** Each ball is assigned a random color, speed, and starting position, contributing to the diversity and unpredictability of the simulation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Interact with the "Add Ball" and "Remove Ball" buttons to control the number of bouncing balls.
